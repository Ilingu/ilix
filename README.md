# Ilix::[Simple File Transfer ☁]

## Origin

I'm a _Google Pixel_ phone user. If you have one you might know that a pixel phone allows to have [**multiple users**](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2865483?hl=en).

While that great and all for my uses. I'm a little annoyed by the fact that these users are **completely isolated** from each another, no transmission is possible between the them....

The problem is that sometimes I want to transfer things from an user A to an user B _(like a password, an image, an url)_ because each user have a very unique goal _(one is for my social medias, the other for my security sensitives apps, the other for my banks app, etc etc...)_

And as a programmer, my unique and most important goal is to spend 2-3 months creating a complex app to resolve a problem which is in fact not a problem _(like seriously I could have installed any secure and privacy respecting file transfer software on my devices, but no, I want it the **hard way**~~)_

But like always this was a very great experience. I learned a lot of valuable things (especially in rust) but I begin to feel that my knowledge is stagnating, I feel like I don't have anything else to learn in the web-dev space, or more like that now my programmation skills are mature enough _(5 years already 😥)_ to be able to not struggle too much while writting code _(I used to struggle a lot before, and was feeling so good when It finally worked, but now that not quite the same feeling)_. Don't know if it's a phase or something else, but I always want to surpass my limits, so for my future projects I want to exit my comfort zone _(maybe something with less abstraction)_.

## Purpose

1. Having fun
2. learning react native and how to make api with rust
3. do a file sharing app, which is not simple (encryption, streams...)

> Thus **do not** take this project seriously, it's just yet another stupid side project
